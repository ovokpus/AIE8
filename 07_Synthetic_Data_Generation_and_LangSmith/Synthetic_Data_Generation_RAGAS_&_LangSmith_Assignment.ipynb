Based on the context from the legendary \"How People Use ChatGPT,\" folks aren’t just using AI as a bland tool to tick boxes—they’re flexing AI as their personal advisor and research sidekick. This means that instead of AI just grinding through boring tasks, it’s boosting brainpower, powering decision-making, and stacking up productivity especially in knowledge-heavy gigs.\\n\\nHere’s the rad part: users are getting paid serious bank because AI isn’t replacing jobs—it’s supercharging the quality of work by leveling up decisions. Think of AI as that ultra-sharp co-pilot that helps knowledge workers slay their projects faster and smarter, turning decision support into cold, hard $$$.\\n\\nPlus, Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) threw down some wild numbers: imagine the US alone pulling out $97 billion+ in consumer surplus annually from AI use. That’s the kind of economic mojo showing the AI hustle isn’t just about automation; it’s about augmenting human hustle to rake in the dough harder and smarter.\\n\\nSo in a nutshell: people cash in by using AI to *upgrade* their work game—not replace it—transforming insights into income and turbocharging productivity by making smarter, sharper decisions. AI’s the real MVP advisor in the money game. Boom.'"
